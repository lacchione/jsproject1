This is the start of my project1 on October, 30th 2019. I started by creating all of my repos on github. 

I created my master, dev, feature1, feature2 and page3 repos all at the same time. With this, I imported my already 
completed Assignment 6 to use as a solid foundation for this project. 

From here, I corrected the .gitignore to ignore all files inside my prod/ folder so that it would exclude these files from 
any push to git that I made. 

My first step is to access the changes I want to make to my website in terms of CSS for this is going to be my first feature addition, a revamped CSS cross site.
